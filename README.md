# d3js-calender-view-with-weeks-and-months

Thanks to Mike Bostock for contributing https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4063318 to D3js. Though this is a very elegent way of presenting timeseriese data, I felt additon of weeks and months will make it intutitive. I looked on the web and found different variations. I liked the simplicity and compactness of this so added Months and Weeks markers to it. I hope it will he helpful for your visualizations.
